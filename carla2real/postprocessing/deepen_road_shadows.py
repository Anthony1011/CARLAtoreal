"""Put CARLA's ground shadows back into a delivered clip, deeper than CARLA renders them.

THE DEFECT. The user has said three times that v50m's shadows are the best in the project and that
nothing since comes close. Measured on ROAD pixels, Town10HD, as the darkest twentieth of the road
over its own median (lower = deeper shadow):

    CARLA source   0.542        v50m   0.269        v75q   0.558
    v85 raw        0.659        v85q   0.630

v50m's road shadows go twice as deep as CARLA's. Every licensed model sits at 0.56-0.66 -- barely
shadowed at all. And v85's raw render (0.659) and delivered clip (0.630) are almost the same, so the
delivery chain is not creating this and cannot be tuned into creating it.

WHY A POST-PASS AND NOT TRAINING. The information is not in the label map: two identical labels at
noon and at four want different shadows, so the generator can only guess, and v80 showed that
handing it a shadow CHANNEL makes it stop learning the surface (-3.6 CIPO). But CARLA knows exactly
where every shadow falls -- it has the geometry and the light. The same argument that makes
protect_lane_markings and protect_buildings work: take from CARLA only what CARLA is authoritative
about, and here that is the SHAPE of the ground shadow.

WHY DEEPER THAN CARLA. Because CARLA is not the target. v50m matches CARLA's contact ratio worst of
every model tested (0.803 against 0.957) and is the one the user prefers. A rendered hard shadow in
CARLA is filled in by ambient; a real one is not. DEEPEN scales (1 - ratio), so 2.0 turns CARLA's
0.542 into 0.084 below its reference -- the knob is calibrated against v50m, not against CARLA.

WHAT IS TRANSFERRED. A luminance RATIO only, so the render keeps its own colour, grain and exposure.
Road and sidewalk only, from the label map. The reference is the lit level of the same class in the
same band of rows, so the correction follows the road's perspective ramp instead of encoding
distance from the camera -- a square window here measures depth, not shadow, which cost three
attempts to learn while building gen_ground_shadow.py.

  usage: deepen_road_shadows.py in.mp4 carla_rgb_dir label_dir out.mp4 [deepen=2.0] [strength=0.9]
CARLA PNGs are BGR-as-RGB, so channels are swapped on read.
